## About this project

### My first project using Python with pygame.
My first version was designed with a GUI but later I decided to adapt it for my Numworks calculator.

It teaches me some basic knowledge : 
- represent a board game with binary representation, manipulate binary number -> move piece left, down, up, rotation.
- mainloop, manage events
- basic use of POO

### Some ideas to improve this project
- make a GUI with visual effects when a piece is merging with the ground
- score
- multiplayer 
- boost : bomb to destroy blocks, slow pieces etc

## How to play 

### Install dependencies with :
pip3 install -e . 

### Command to play
- use arrow keys to move
- up arrow key to turn the piece
