##About this project

#My first project using Python with pygame.
My first version was designed with a GUI but later I decided to adapt it for my Numworks calculator.

It teaches me some basic knowledge : 
- represent a board game with binary representation, manipulate binary number -> move piece left, down, up etc.
- mainloop, manage events

#Some ideas to improve this project
- make a GUI with visual effects when a piece is merging with the ground
- score
- destroy a line when it is filled
- multiplayer 
- boost : bomb to destroy blocks, slow pieces etc

##How to play 

#Install dependencies with :

pip3 install -e . 

#Command to play
- use arrow keys to move
- up arrow key to turn the piece
